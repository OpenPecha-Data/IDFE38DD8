Aspiration Prayer1
by the Fourth Dodrupchen Rinpoche, Tupten Trinlé Pal Zangpo

Glorious embodiment of all the buddhas,
pema jungné tukjé ter
Padmākara, treasury of compassion,
dak gi yi tsor taktu zhuk
Remain forever in the lake of my mind.
tuk yi chik tu drepar shok
Let my mind and your wisdom merge as one.

marik nyönmong wang gyurpé
May all those under the sway of ignorance and the kleśas,
dukngal sum gyi zirwa yi
And are thus tormented by the three kinds of suffering,
gyü druk khorwé semchen kün
All the sentient beings of the six classes within saṃsāra,
tukjé drol chik guru jé
Be freed through your compassion, O precious guru!

dak kyang nekab tamché du
May I never fall prey at any time
tsul min yijé zhenwang gi
To inappropriate modes of thought
chö min lam du mi chenpar
And thereby stray onto non-dharmic paths,
ngejung khoné gyü len shok
But let renunciation alone suffuse my being.

gangdak dé dang majönpé
May I emulate the buddhas
sangye jesu dak lob ching
Of the past, present and future,
changchub chöpa tayepé
And through the infinite activity of a bodhisattva,
drowé pal du gyurwar shok
Become a source of splendour for all beings.

In response to a request from the supreme Alak Zenkar incarnation, Tudeng Nima Rinpoche, who
is a champion of the Great Perfection teachings, the one called the Fourth Dodrupchen wrote
this in England on the twenty-first day of the sixth month of the Iron Sheep year.2 May
virtue abound!
